HyperCube Parts

Additional part for [HyperCube Evolution](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2254103) and [Ultimaker Clone](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:811271)

I initialy started with Ultimaker Clone 3d printer. But after some time corexy was getting much better adoption, and HyperCube is really a nice machine. So in the middle of project i have switched to HyperCube CoreXY printer. Here you can find some of the parts i have changed/remixed or modeled from scratch so this machine would be what it is today.
