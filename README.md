HyperCube Parts

Additional part for [HyperCube Evolution](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1178406) and [Ultimaker Clone](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1178406)

I initialy started with Ultimaker Clone, but corexy seemed much nicer in the end so i have adopted hypercube, and this are some of the parts to make that transition nicer.
